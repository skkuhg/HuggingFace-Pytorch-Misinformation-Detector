## üß™ Development Guidelines

### Code Style

We use:
- **Black** for code formatting
- **Flake8** for linting
- **Type hints** for better code documentation
- **Docstrings** for all public functions and classes

Example:
```python
def process_claim(self, claim: str, style: str = 'fact_check') -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """
    Process a single claim through the misinformation detection pipeline.
    
    Args:
        claim: The text claim to analyze
        style: Visual style for generated graphics
        
    Returns:
        Dictionary containing analysis results and generated content
        
    Raises:
        ValueError: If claim is empty or invalid
    """
    pass
```

### Testing

- Write tests for all new functionality
- Maintain test coverage above 80%
- Include both unit tests and integration tests
- Test edge cases and error conditions

Example test structure:
```python
def test_claim_processing():
    """Test basic claim processing functionality."""
    pipeline = MisinformationPipeline()
    result = pipeline.process_claim("Test claim")
    
    assert 'verdict' in result
    assert 'confidence' in result['verdict']
    assert result['verdict']['confidence'] >= 0.0
```

### Documentation

- Add docstrings to all public functions
- Update README.md for significant changes
- Include examples for new features
- Comment complex algorithms

## üö® Important Considerations

### Ethical Guidelines

This project deals with sensitive topics. Please ensure:

- **No Bias Introduction**: Avoid introducing political, cultural, or personal biases
- **Factual Accuracy**: Base corrections on reliable, scientific sources
- **Transparency**: Clearly indicate AI-generated content limitations
- **Responsible Use**: Consider potential misuse of the technology

### Privacy and Safety

- Never include personal information in test data
- Avoid processing sensitive or private content
- Respect data protection regulations
- Consider security implications of new features

### Model and Data Considerations

- Use only publicly available, ethically sourced models
- Respect model licensing terms
- Avoid training on biased or harmful datasets
- Document model limitations and potential biases

## üìã Pull Request Checklist
